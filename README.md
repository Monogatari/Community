    2. Description
    3. Last version of Monogatari with which it's compatible

## Good Practices

### Include a Header
Include a header in your code, here's a nice template:

```
/*
 * ==============================
 * The Name of your Component/Theme/Asset
 * ==============================
 * Author: Your Name <example@example.com>
 * Monogatari Version: 1.4.1
 * Component Version: 0.1.0
 * License: MIT | GPLv3 | etc
 * ==============================
 * 
 */
```
